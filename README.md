Smart-Home-Automation-Using-ATmega32
This project implements an intelligent home automation system leveraging ATmega32 microcontroller, sensors, and actuators to ensure a safer and more comfortable living environment. The system automatically controls lighting and fan speed based on environmental inputs such as light intensity, temperature, and fire presence.
Features:
- **Lighting Control:** Uses LDR sensors to monitor ambient light and control Red, Green, and Blue LEDs accordingly.
- **Fan Speed Adjustment:** Adapts fan speed via PWM based on real-time temperature measurements from the LM35 sensor.
- **Fire Detection:** Employs a flame sensor to trigger alarms and display critical alerts upon fire detection.
- **Real-Time Display:** 16x2 LCD shows current temperature, light intensity, fan status, and alerts.
- **Safety & Alerts:** Automated responses to fire incidents with visual and audio alarms.

Technologies:
- ATmega32 Microcontroller
- Sensors: LM35 Temperature Sensor, LDR, Flame Sensor
- Actuators: DC Motor (Fan), LEDs, Buzzer
- Communication: ADC, PWM, GPIO
- Display: 16x2 LCD

This project showcases embedded system integration for environmental monitoring and automation, perfect for smart home applications.
